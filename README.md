## Description
#### OneForAll, it is a fully functioning C2C E-commerce website where people get to buy and sell products through a points-based billing system. And for the administrator there is a dashboard where he/she could look into reports, send points as part of the loyalty program, make announcements, see stats, and manage the whole website. The project was built using React for the front-end by Bilal Youness and I, and using larval for the back-end by Hayyan Al-Jaber. Our customers will meet their needs with all kinds of products in just one place, it's OneForAll
